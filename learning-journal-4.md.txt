Journal day 4

What a week!  Day one and two I was chomping at the bit but feeling underwhealmed with the material.  Last night is when
shit hit the proverbial fan.  Not in a bad way, but I was trying to create a loop and failed at it for at least 2 hours. 
I eventually took some help from my brothers and significantly helped me with the code.

The logic aspect of learning js, html, and css is the most intellecually stimulating thing I have ever done in my life.
I am equal parts frustrated, challenged, and excited and inspired.  I haven't immersed myself into something like this in
a long, long time, and it feels great.

That said, aside from the problem solving challenges (which are fun), for me the biggest challenge has come from managing 
and learning how to use all of the tools outside of coding.  Canvas does not feel intuitive at all, and it's been challenging
to know where to go for various pieces of information.  For example, I would expect to see lab outlines and such in Canvas,
but I then would have to spend 5-10 minutes backtracking all of the new apps I installed and various links and pages within these
the new apps to try and find the information I need.  I have made crushing mistakes in git bash i.e. deleting hours of work I 
had done, I have thought I have submitted assignments only to find out I hadn't.  Learning the code has been awesome, the 
other stuff actually has me a bit nervous.  I don't want this mundane stuff to affect my progress, but it's starting to feel
overwhealming and extremely frustrating.

All in all, this experience has already been priceless and the future implications of this experience are very exciting.
I am confident I will iron out these problems with git hub, git bash, canvas etc...
